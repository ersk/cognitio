Research & Development



Learning & Research

Research Speed = Default based on Race (intelligence)


Ideas 
	They create a new research path
	E.g. “” Walk on Water” > opens research to boats
	Ideas happen early and are quite random - still based on knowledge level

Research Buildings
	Exploratory Research => Technology & Ideology
		
		Anything
			Economic
				Consumable
					Farming
						Grain
						Fruit
						Veg
							Individual
						Other?
							Cotton
					Ranching
				
			Military
				Soldiering
				Vehicles
				
			Imperial
				Buildings
				Research
				Culture
				Morale
		
		
		Choose focus
		More focus = more time to research
	
<Building>
	Improvement research => Bonuses
	Implementation of technology

			Longsword Smithy

More specific building 
	More efficient
	Quicker at researching
	
Change building into research mode?

Clothing

Population in Colder climates have a need/higher demand for more clothes

Cotton > Cotton 
Flax > Linen 			- good for warm weather (breathable) 

Plantation = produces flax
Spinners = flax > linen
Clothier = linen > linen clothes

Ranch (sheep) = raw wool
Spinners =  raw wool > wool
 

Tangoloff = lofftus > lofftus thread > lofftus clothes  - bright? / warm /flammable material?


Multiplier for having clothes + soap?


Plant fibers = bamboo, hemp, corn, nettle, and soy fiber.
